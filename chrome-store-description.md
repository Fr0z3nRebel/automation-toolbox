**Stop switching tabs and repeating clicks.** Automation Toolbox puts Artistly’s power in a side panel—batch image generation, instant navigation to any tool, and a clipboard helper so you can paste blocks of text without retyping.

**Quick Navigation**
Search or browse and jump straight to the tool you need—AI Art Illustrator, design assistants, storybook studio, design agents, kids puzzles, image designer v6, and more. No digging through menus. One click and you’re there.

**AI Art Illustrator automation**
Run multiple prompts in one go. Pick a style from 79+ options (searchable), paste your prompts (one per block), hit Start, and let the extension handle the rest. It selects the style, fills the prompt, and advances through each image while you watch progress (total images, current image, percentage). Ideal for books, series, or bulk assets.

**Clipboard tool**
Paste a block of text with blank lines between sentences or paragraphs. Split it into sections. Each section gets its own card: edit the text, copy with one click, or delete what you don’t need. Clear and start over anytime. Perfect for forms, captions, or any place you paste the same chunks repeatedly.

**Built for how you work**
- Stays in a side panel—no tab clutter
- Works with your current Artistly tab
- Simple, dark UI that stays out of the way

If you use Artistly for design, illustration, or content, Automation Toolbox saves time every time you open it.
